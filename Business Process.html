<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>## Business Process

A.	Electrical Changes Process:
This includes product number 191D1234E001, E002, and E003. If the change is electric be sure to ask if it is safety related. If it is safety related if follows process #EEE999 below.
A1.	Identification of Need for Change:
o	Recognize the need for an electrical design change. This could be due to safety concerns, performance improvements, or compliance requirements. Be sure to follow direction if safety related.
A2.	Request Initiation:
o	Create a formal request for the electrical change. Include details such as the reason for the change, affected components, and desired outcomes in Form #1234
A3.	Impact Assessment:
o	Evaluate the impact of the proposed change on existing systems, equipment, and infrastructure. Make sure to hold a Pre-job brief
o	Consider safety, cost, schedule, and compatibility with other systems.
A4.	Design Modification:
o	Develop the revised electrical design. Ensure no other changes to parts EP-1002
o	Update schematics, wiring diagrams, and specifications.
A5.	Review and Approval:
o	Present the modified design to relevant stakeholders (engineers, managers, safety officers).
o	Obtain necessary approvals.
A6.	Implementation:
o	Execute the design change by updating wiring, components, or control systems.
o	Ensure proper documentation and labeling.
A7.	Testing and Validation:
o	Verify that the new electrical design functions correctly.
o	Conduct tests, inspections, and functional checks.
A8.	Documentation Update:
o	Revise documentation (manuals, maintenance procedures) to reflect the change.
o	Archive old versions.
B. Product Changes Process:
This includes product numbers 191D1234P001, 191D1234P002, and 191D1234P003
B1.	Change Request Initiation:
o	Identify the need for a product design change (e.g., features, materials, aesthetics).
o	Document the proposed modification on form PCP-123
B2.	Impact Assessment:
o	Assess the impact on product functionality, cost, and manufacturability.
o	Consider customer requirements and regulatory compliance.
B3.	Design Modification:
o	Modify the product design (CAD models, drawings, specifications).
o	Collaborate with design engineers and stakeholders.
B4.	Prototyping and Testing:
o	Create a prototype of the modified product.
o	Test for performance, durability, and safety.
B5.	Approval and Release:
o	Obtain approvals from product managers, quality assurance, and marketing.
o	Update product documentation.
B6.	Manufacturing Transition:
o	Communicate changes to the manufacturing team.
o	Update production processes, tooling, and assembly instructions.
C. Manufacturing Changes Process:
	Typical product numbers include PRCS-1234, PRCS-3444, and PRCS-9000
C1.	Change Request Initiation:
o	Identify the need for a manufacturing process change (e.g., efficiency, cost reduction, quality improvement).
o	Document the proposed change.
C2.	Impact Assessment:
o	Evaluate the impact on production throughput, labor, and resources.
o	Consider safety and environmental factors.
C3.	Process Modification:
o	Modify the manufacturing process steps.
o	Update work instructions, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and training materials.
C4.	Testing and Validation:
o	Test the modified process using pilot runs or simulations.
o	Validate the changes against performance metrics.
C5.	Approval and Implementation:
o	Obtain approvals from production managers and quality control.
o	Implement the revised process on the production floor.
C6.	Training and Communication:
o	Train operators and technicians on the updated process.
o	Communicate changes across the organization.
D. Process EEE999 for electrical changes
	- When safety direct process are changed, you must first gain approval by William Disterdick to make the change.  Further action will be directed from him.
